Redux is an independent library of react jsRedux is used to manage the state in react. We can use react hooks if the application is small but if the application is big it will be not easy to manage state with hooks. In redux toolkit there is a store , slice, reducer and actions. First there is slice all our data are managed we use a initial state and other actions like adding. Or deleting or any kind of action in our application.. We need to pass our actions to reducers and then add it to store. We can add as many slice actions resources in our store. Next we need to wrap our index.js app with provider and pass store in it then all the components inside app will have the access to use it .Then if we need to add any functionality or any http request we just need to add action in our slice thus it becomes so much easy to access data from any where
